      'Content': '<p>\r\n\t<span><div>Wonder Woman is a groundbreaking film. Not only is it the first film to star the iconic character created over 75 years ago, it is the first big female-led studio superhero film in over a decade, not to mention being the first studio superhero film directed by a woman.</div></span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<div>With breaking glass ceilings comes high expectations, and upon the film&rsquo;s release, doubts were put to rest as Wonder Woman achieved near universal praise from critics and fans alike.</div></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<div>But while Wonder Woman feels so fresh, Gal Gadot, the titular star, doesn&rsquo;t believe Wonder Woman is doing anything particularly novel. Rather, she credits the film&rsquo;s success on its earnest, straightforward approach to the material. She mentions they are genuine and open and vulnerable to all cynicism.</div></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<div>When it comes to the director Patty Jenkins, Gadot praises her as &ldquo;an amazing partner&rdquo; and she would rather like to idolize Jenkins out of her dedication than her gender. They communicate to build an accessible character by presenting her drawbacks and imperfections. An existent and interesting role is exactly what Gadot loves to play.</div></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<div>As for the co-star Chris Pine, he meant more than a partner to Gadot, for it was her first lead role ever and Chris guided her nicely with his experience and humor. The funny colleague also made Gadot break many takes with laughter.</div></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<div>While Gadot&rsquo;s natural screen presence immediately sells the audience on her ability to embody the enduringly-popular character, the film itself is an origin story, largely setting the stage for who Wonder Woman will grow to be. In Gadot&rsquo;s eyes, one film isn&rsquo;t nearly enough to capture the character. A whole series likely awaits.</div></p>r\n',

I went to go open the door and he had the lettuce in his hand with a big smileã€‚&quot; </div></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<div>&quot;I just started laughing so much. After, I hugged and kissed him.
